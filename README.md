"app" made for cube bike during my internship, the point is to count the pistakes of a robotic machine producing 3 different types of plate called "patrone" in german,the point was to put everything gathered by it in excel files, it does that by downloading a csv file at each run, and then you just have to import manually into excel, wich takes seconds.
